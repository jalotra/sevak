# Project Objective : 
  
- "BRD" : 
    - To make a custom CCTV like functionality at home.
    - Functionalities include : {streaming video to a streaming server on demand, writing APIs for getting realtime images(night vision kind of later), Telegram BOT as UI}.


Language Stack :     
- Python
- GoLang
- Java
- C++ / C 
- Bash
- Open Source Tools as much as possible.
- APIs in GoLang.

PRD:
- Will be starting off with writing docs for APIs that I have to write. 
- EDGE IOT will be build over BerryNet. 
- Will be using a Free EC2 instance that hosts the API server(written in GoLang) an talks to my RaspberryPi(have to see what protocol to use here !)
- Live Streaming
- Image on Demand
- On Horizon : Temperature Sensor, more sensors here, how to package the hardware and make it accessible in practical applications.
